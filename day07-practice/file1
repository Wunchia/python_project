I was so honored to be invited to be the inaugural Class Day Speaker. 
But obviously since I’m a graduate of the University of Chicago, I couldn’t just accept the invitation. I had to overanalyze it. 
My first thought was that since this is Chicago it couldn’t just be class day; maybe it was class conflict day with special appearances by Marx and Engels and Race, Class and Gender day with Betty Friedan T-Shirts.
